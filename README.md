### 👋 Hi there I'm Ben, a digital product designer, specialising in UX, performance, and accessibility.


I've been designing and building fast, inclusive websites that since 2005, that's 15 years!

I live in Manchester, a thriving tech hub in the UK, with my girlfriend, four taller than average children and our shit zhu Phoebe.

- 👷🏻‍♂️ I’m currently working on a marketplace for fashion that'll benefit shoppers and the environment!
- 🌱 I’m learning how to use async await JavaScript in Firebase Cloud functions.

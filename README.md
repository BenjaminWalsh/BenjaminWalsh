### Hi I'm Ben 👋 

...a digital product designer, specialising in UX, performance, and accessibility.

I've been designing and building fast, inclusive websites that offer a great user experience for fourteen years.

I live in Manchester, a thriving tech hub in the UK, with my <del>red and orange</del> purple and blue haired girlfriend, four taller than average children and our shitzhu Phoebe.
